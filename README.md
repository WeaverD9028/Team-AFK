## Sprint 1

**Amiyah**: Created the aesthetics of the login and sign up pages that will eventually mark how the rest of the app should look. Including: font, layout, colors, etc. Added menu items to the menu selection that will include necessary tabs in future sprints, such as "Car Health", "Local Autoshops", "DIY Videos", etc. 

**Keiser** I created the functionality of the login and sign-up activities. Afterwards, I added user navigation between the main, login, and sign-up activities, then I connected the app to Firebase authentication service to handle account creation, management, and access. 

**Frankie**  My tasks were working on the layout and functionality of the car selection menu page. I got the dropdown menus for the Make, Model, and Year made, but they aren't populated because we did not get our database populated with our API yet. I also got the "Continue" button that leads to the Symptoms page to function.

**Dylan** Worked on the menu and buttons on the symptoms activity page. I included different car symptoms such as flat tires,noisy engine,etc. My buttons were a continue,back,and a more issues buttons.

**Daniel** I created the database structure the whole app will be using to make the report of the car. I also connected a dummy API to the app just to see if the app can connect to a API.

## Sprint 2

**Amiyah**: Created the layout for both the Settings and Car Health page, allowing the user to access the app's preferences and enter when they last had a certain type of maintenance performed on their car. User is also allowed to change their car type and information post-setup. 


**Keiser**: Created the diagnostics template page that displays: vehicle type, date of submittal, potential issues(1 to 4), price estimate. Also, it has image buttons that will later take you to maps and diy videos pages. Finally, added navigation between all current activites to show app flow for demo.


**Frankie**:I was tasked with creating the DIY Video activity created. The first days I did research on using the youtube api and next I had to create the activity itself but i ran into trouble with Android Studio itself. I had to run many updates after reinstalling Android Studio and it finally worked. While waiting I had already typed up the code in notepad but once trying to merge that code with the activity on Android Studio I had many errors.


**Dylan**:Created the vehicle issues page to input dates,worked on google maps api to be able to pinpoint locations of autoshops,and a search issues page to be able to search for more car related issues.

**Daniel**: Connnected our app to the API to connect populated the database and get car infomation like year, make, model. Also can get engine types maintance details and more infomation.


## Sprint 3

**Amiyah**:


**Keiser**: Created the diagnostics loading activity that will be displayed for 10 seconds before showing the user a diagnostic report. Also, created  the saved reports activity that will store previously filed diagnostics reports. The individual reports are clickable and take you back to diagnostic page for now. 


**Frankie**: Converted the Youtube tab into a web view and tried to be able to access that tab through the navigation menu. The tabs on the navigation menu are all items and i have not figured out on to set a click listener on an item yet.
