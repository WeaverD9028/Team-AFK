# Team-AFK

## Sprint 1

**Amiyah**: Created the aesthetics of the login and sign up pages that will eventually mark how the rest of the app should look. Including: font, layout, colors, etc. Added menu items to the menu selection that will include necessary tabs in future sprints, such as "Car Health", "Local Autoshops", "DIY Videos", etc. 

**Keiser** I created the functionality of the login and sign-up activities. Afterwards, I added user navigation between the main, login, and sign-up activities, then I connected the app to Firebase authentication service to handle account creation, management, and access. 

**Frankie**  My tasks were working on the layout and functionality of the car selection menu page. I got the dropdown menus for the Make, Model, and Year made, but they aren't populated because we did not get our database populated with our API yet. I also got the "Continue" button that leads to the Symptoms page to function.

**Dylan** Worked on the menu and buttons on the symptoms activity page. I included different car symptoms such as flat tires,noisy engine,etc. My buttons were a continue,back,and a more issues buttons.

**Daniel** I created the database structure the whole app will be using to make the report of the car. I also connected a dummy API to the app just to see if the app can connect to a API.

## Sprint 2

**Amiyah**: Created the layout for both the Settings and Car Health page, allowing the user to access the app's preferences and enter when they last had a certain type of maintenance performed on their car. User is also allowed to change their car type and information post-setup. 


**Keiser**: Created the diagnostics template page that displays: vehicle type, date of submittal, potential issues(1 to 4), price estimate. Also, it has image buttons that will later take you to maps and diy videos pages. Finally, added navigation between all current activites to show app flow for demo.
