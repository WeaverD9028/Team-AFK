## Sprint 1

**Amiyah**: Created the aesthetics of the login and sign up pages that will eventually mark how the rest of the app should look. Including: font, layout, colors, etc. Added menu items to the menu selection that will include necessary tabs in future sprints, such as "Car Health", "Local Autoshops", "DIY Videos", etc. 

**Keiser** I created the functionality of the login and sign-up activities. Afterwards, I added user navigation between the main, login, and sign-up activities, then I connected the app to Firebase authentication service to handle account creation, management, and access. 

**Frankie**  My tasks were working on the layout and functionality of the car selection menu page. I got the dropdown menus for the Make, Model, and Year made, but they aren't populated because we did not get our database populated with our API yet. I also got the "Continue" button that leads to the Symptoms page to function.
